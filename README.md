brb-universe
============

A password generator that will make bruteforcers wait a universe.

Why a universe?
===============

brb-universe can generate the longest passwords, use all allowed 
characters for a specific security and it will correct the initially 
generated password by making each character appear as little times 
as possible within a password (that's not implemented yet though).

Long random passwords are difficult to remember!
================================================

Long passwords can be written down, but that isn't the most secure way.
When used enough times, a difficult password can be memorized.
